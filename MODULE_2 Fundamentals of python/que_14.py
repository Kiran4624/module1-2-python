"""What are negative indexes and why are they used?

Negative indexing is used in Python to manipulate sequence objects such as lists,

arrays, strings, etc.

Negative indexing retrieves elements from the end by providing negative numbers

as sequence indexes.

Negative indexing allows you to access elements of a sequence from the end, 

using negative numbers as indexes .

e.g
a = [1, 2, 3, 4] a list of four numbers.
print(a[-1])  prints the last element of the list.
